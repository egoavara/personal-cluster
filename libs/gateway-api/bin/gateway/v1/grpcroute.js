/**
 * GRPCRoute provides a way to route gRPC requests. This includes the capability
 * to match requests by hostname, gRPC service, gRPC method, or HTTP/2 header.
 * Filters can be used to specify additional processing steps. Backends specify
 * where matching requests will be routed.
 *
 * GRPCRoute falls under extended support within the Gateway API. Within the
 * following specification, the word "MUST" indicates that an implementation
 * supporting GRPCRoute must conform to the indicated requirement, but an
 * implementation not supporting this route type need not follow the requirement
 * unless explicitly indicated.
 *
 * Implementations supporting `GRPCRoute` with the `HTTPS` `ProtocolType` MUST
 * accept HTTP/2 connections without an initial upgrade from HTTP/1.1, i.e. via
 * ALPN. If the implementation does not support this, then it MUST set the
 * "Accepted" condition to "False" for the affected listener with a reason of
 * "UnsupportedProtocol".  Implementations MAY also accept HTTP/2 connections
 * with an upgrade from HTTP/1.
 *
 * Implementations supporting `GRPCRoute` with the `HTTP` `ProtocolType` MUST
 * support HTTP/2 over cleartext TCP (h2c,
 * https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7540#section-3.1) without an initial
 * upgrade from HTTP/1.1, i.e. with prior knowledge
 * (https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7540#section-3.4). If the implementation
 * does not support this, then it MUST set the "Accepted" condition to "False"
 * for the affected listener with a reason of "UnsupportedProtocol".
 * Implementations MAY also accept HTTP/2 connections with an upgrade from
 * HTTP/1, i.e. without prior knowledge.
