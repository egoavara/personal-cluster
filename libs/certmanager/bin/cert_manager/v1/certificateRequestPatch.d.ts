 * Patch resources are used to modify existing Kubernetes resources by using

 * one patch may be applied to the same resource, and a random FieldManager name will be used for each Patch resource.
 * Conflicts will result in an error by default, but can be forced using the "pulumi.com/patchForce" annotation. See the
 * [Server-Side Apply Docs](https://www.pulumi.com/registry/packages/kubernetes/how-to-guides/managing-resources-with-server-side-apply/) for
 * additional information about using Server-Side Apply to manage Kubernetes resources with Pulumi.
 * A CertificateRequest is used to request a signed certificate from one of the configured issuers.
 *  All fields within the CertificateRequest's `spec` are immutable after creation. A CertificateRequest will either succeed or fail, as denoted by its `Ready` status condition and its `status.failureTime` field.
 *  A CertificateRequest is a one-shot resource, meaning it represents a single point in time request for a certificate and cannot be re-used.
